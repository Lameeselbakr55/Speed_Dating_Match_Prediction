# Speed_Dating_Match_Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the outcome of speed dating sessions based on the profiles of two individuals. The goal is to develop a recommendation system that can better match people in speed dating events. The task is a binary classification problem, where we aim to predict the probability (ranging from 0 to 1) that a dating session will lead to a successful match.

**The inputs:**  The input data we're dealing with is a profile of each participant in the session.


**The output:** the probability (0-1) that the dating session will lead to a successful match.


**The data mining function:** Binary Classification.

**Challenges**
* Missing values handling as there are very large number of missings
* data imbalance
* select best processing method for filling the missing
* select best model to deploy
* many parameter to choose from them for models


**Impact**

The impact is to Understand the features that contribute to successful matches, Furthermore, this would provide an opportunity to make useful recommendations for future speed dating events.



**Ideal solution**

An ideal solution will effectively creating a dataset-representative missing value replacement technique and optimising hyperparameters to make the most correct estimates possible.
